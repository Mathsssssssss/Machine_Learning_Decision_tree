# Machine_Learning_Decision_tree
ML Model for Rheumatoid Arthritis Prediction
Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to predict and understand rheumatoid arthritis, a rare disease with limited available information. The aim is to leverage the trained model to gain more insights into the disease.

Project Objectives
Develop a machine learning model to predict rheumatoid arthritis.
Use the model to extract and understand more information about the disease.
Utilize decision tree algorithm for its effectiveness in branching and differentiating causes.
Why Rheumatoid Arthritis?
Rheumatoid arthritis was chosen due to the scarcity of comprehensive information about the disease, making it a challenging and impactful project.

Methodology
Algorithm: Decision Tree
Selected for its capability to branch and differentiate between various causes effectively.
Dataset: Sourced from Kaggle
The dataset from Kaggle was instrumental in developing and training the model.
Results
The decision tree model provided valuable insights into the factors contributing to rheumatoid arthritis, helping to bridge the information gap about the disease.
Conclusion
This project demonstrates the potential of machine learning in understanding rare diseases like rheumatoid arthritis, providing a foundation for further research and development.
